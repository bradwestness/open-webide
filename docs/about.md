# About and open-source software

Open the account menu and choose **About**, or search for
**About**, **version**, **commit** or **licenses** in the command palette.

The **About** tab shows the running frontend's version and Git commit, including a modified
source marker for development builds. It uses the same component and bundled
content for local and remote projects. Build details are bundled with the app;
license notices load from a versioned static asset when their tab opens. Escape or Close dismisses it and restores focus.

The About view is centered in a compact dialog. Select the **Open-source software**
tab to load the license inventory into its own scroll area, then expand a library
or bundled asset to read its license text and copyright notices.
The inventory follows `Cargo.lock`, including direct, transitive, vendored,
platform-specific and build/test dependencies. Individual binaries use a subset.
It includes the original Monaspace font and Lucide icon notices. Where a crate
archive omits its notice, a version-pinned upstream copy is bundled when available;
entries without a full text say so and link to the upstream project.

Once the PWA has cached a build, the offline connection screen links to
**About**. Its standalone page uses the cached build's
version, commit, inventory and styles without requiring sign-in or an API request.
External project links still require network access.

## Building notices

Frontend builds require Python 3. The app and website share
`tools/open_source.py`; Cargo metadata and the resolved local crate distributions
supply the inventory. Notice generation never downloads upstream license texts.
Keep the exact-version entries in `third-party/notices/index.json` current when
updating dependencies that omit notices from their published archives.

Git source builds derive their commit automatically. Docker's build context
excludes `.git`; provide the revision when building an image:

```sh
docker build --build-arg OPENWEBIDE_BUILD_COMMIT="$(git rev-parse HEAD)" -t openwebide .
```

CI and release image builds supply the revision automatically. Source archives
and image builds without a supplied revision show that the commit is unknown.
