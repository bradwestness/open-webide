# Local and remote projects

A workspace determines where project files live. Model hosting is a separate
choice: a remote project can use a LAN model server, and a local project can use
a model server elsewhere.

| Capability | Remote project | Local project |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Folder picker | App host's configured workspace | Browser device's folders |
| File access | Backend workspace mount | Browser File System Access API |
| Editor and file workflows | Shared app behavior | Shared app behavior |
| Commands and Git | Host execution bridge | Bridge on the browser device that can access the folder |
| Directory access after reload | Host mount remains available | Browser may require permission again |

## Remote projects

Choose **Open remote** and select a folder under the configured workspace.
In containers, `OPENWEBIDE_WORKSPACE` selects the host directory mounted as
`/workspace`. The agent's commands run on the bridge host, using the tools installed
there. Installing a compiler on your browser's computer does not install it in
the container.

Remote projects also support switching devices: your desktop and phone connect to
the same host files and database-backed sessions. Mobile browsers without directory
picking can use remote projects through [private HTTPS](tailscale.md).

## Local projects

Choose **Open local** in a browser supporting the File System Access API.
Folder access requires a secure context: localhost works for development, and
[HTTPS](tailscale.md) is the route for other devices. Grant permission to the
folder when the browser requests it.

The app stores the directory handle in origin-bound IndexedDB; project/session
metadata and preferences remain database-backed. Reopening from another device
does not grant that device access to the original device's files.

Commands and Git need a bridge on the device holding the folder. The bridge must
see the selected project within five directory levels of its workspace; matching uses a temporary
probe file that is removed afterward. Without a reachable, matched bridge, those
tools are hidden and Chat explains the missing capability. File editing can still
use browser folder access.

See [bridge setup and pairing](execution-bridge.md) for configuration. The app
does not upload the entire local project to turn it into a remote workspace.
