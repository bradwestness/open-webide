# Execution bridge

The native bridge daemon (`openwebide-bridge`) runs on the host to provide interactive PTY terminals, process execution (`POST /exec`), and host Git operations for the web frontend and coding agents. The backend reaches the bridge at `127.0.0.1:3001` and sends project-relative `cwd`.

> [!NOTE]
> Git operations performed by the bridge require Git ≥ 2.23 on the host machine for branch switching via `git switch`.

The bridge's HTTP/1 and WebSocket server (built on `hyper`) enforces request limits: a 16 KiB
HTTP request head, a 1 MiB `/exec`/Git request body, a 16 MiB WebSocket message/frame, and 256
concurrent connections. Idle sockets are closed after 10 s without a request head; WebSocket
connections are pinged every 30 s and closed after 90 s without an inbound frame.

## Running the bridge

```sh
cargo build -p openwebide-bridge
./target/debug/openwebide-bridge --port 3001 --workspace ../.. --host 127.0.0.1 \
  --backend-url http://127.0.0.1:3000/api --secret-file /tmp/openwebide-bridge-secret
```

Signed-in connections can run chat and agents over the bridge when it shares the
backend's secret. The frontend selects WebSocket runs when `hello_ok` advertises
run support. In browser DevTools, prompts send `run_start` and replies arrive as
`run_event` frames. Local agents remain in the browser and request model
completions through `completion_start`.

HTTP-only builds (`cargo build -p openwebide-bridge --no-default-features`)
advertise no run support; terminal and Git operations remain available.
See [chat execution and fallback](architecture.md#chat-execution-and-streaming)
for transport selection, and [reload recovery](reload-recovery.md) for reconnect
and interrupted-run behavior.

- `--backend-url <URL>` (or env `OPENWEBIDE_BRIDGE_BACKEND_URL`): backend API URL for run plans and persistence (default: `http://127.0.0.1:3000/api`); set it on the daemon, never in a client request. A frontend `?api=` development override needs a matching `--backend-url`.
- `--workspace <DIR>` (or env `OPENWEBIDE_BRIDGE_WORKSPACE`): sets the workspace root directory for command execution and repository operations (defaults to the current working directory). This directory must match the `files` source mount used by the Spin backend (e.g. `~/source` locally or `/workspace` in Docker). All `cwd` arguments passed to the bridge are evaluated relative to this root, and requests escaping the root are rejected (lexical confinement).
- `-p, --port <PORT>` (or env `OPENWEBIDE_BRIDGE_PORT`): port to bind on (default: `3001`).
- `--host <HOST>` (or env `OPENWEBIDE_BRIDGE_HOST`): host address to bind on (default: `127.0.0.1`). To expose the bridge to your local network (e.g. phone/tablet use over LAN or Tailscale), bind to `0.0.0.0` or a specific LAN IP:
  ```sh
  ./target/debug/openwebide-bridge --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3001
  ```
- `--secret-file <FILE>`: persistent shared-secret file for non-browser API commands. `OPENWEBIDE_BRIDGE_SECRET` overrides the file and must contain at least 32 characters. Otherwise a persistent random 32-byte secret is stored at `--secret-file`, `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/openwebide/bridge-secret`, or `~/.config/openwebide/bridge-secret`. The backend lazily fetches it over loopback via `POST /secret` and caches it in SQLite.
- `--token <TOKEN>` (or env `OPENWEBIDE_BRIDGE_TOKEN`): Optional pairing token (≥ 16 characters) to authenticate local companion apps without needing the backend's minted session tokens. Allows local-mode execution: `openwebide-bridge --token <16+ chars> --workspace <path>`.

> [!WARNING]
> When the backend reaches a remote bridge through a non-loopback URL, set both `SPIN_VARIABLE_BRIDGE_URL=http://<bridge-host>:3001` and `SPIN_VARIABLE_BRIDGE_SECRET` to the bridge secret from its secret file or `OPENWEBIDE_BRIDGE_SECRET`. The daemon logs the secret source, never the secret itself. Binding to `0.0.0.0` still permits automatic bootstrap when the backend connects over loopback.

## Host and Origin security baseline

To protect against DNS rebinding and malicious websites opened in the user's browser, the bridge validates incoming HTTP and WebSocket requests:

1. **Host Header Rules:**
   - Allowed if the `Host` is an **IP literal** (IPv4 or IPv6, e.g. `127.0.0.1`, `[::1]`, `192.168.1.50`).
   - Allowed if `localhost`, this machine's hostname (e.g. `mymachine`), or `<hostname>.local`.
   - Allowed if explicitly added via `--allowed-host <HOSTNAME>` (or `OPENWEBIDE_BRIDGE_ALLOWED_HOSTS` comma-separated list).
   - Any unrecognized or rebinding domain name is rejected with `403 Forbidden`.

2. **Origin & CORS Rules:**
   - Requests without an `Origin` header (such as Spin backend calls, `curl`, and local daemon tools) are permitted, but API routes require authorization via `Authorization: Bearer <SECRET>`. For example:
     ```sh
     curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3001/exec \
       -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-secret>" \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{"command": "echo test"}'
     ```
   - Browser requests with an `Origin` header are permitted only if:
     - The origin is in the allowed origins list (default: `http://localhost:3000`, `http://127.0.0.1:3000`, `http://localhost:8080`, `http://127.0.0.1:8080`, plus any `--allowed-origin` entries); **or**
     - The origin's hostname matches the request's `Host` hostname (allowing phone/LAN access when the frontend and bridge are accessed on the same host machine).
   - `Origin: null` and untrusted cross-origin requests are rejected with `403 Forbidden`.
   - Wildcard `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` is disabled; allowed origins receive their exact origin echoed with `Vary: Origin`.

3. **JSON-Only Browser POSTs:**
   - Browser POST requests carrying an `Origin` header require `Content-Type: application/json`; simple browser requests (e.g. `text/plain`, form-urlencoded) are rejected with `415 Unsupported Media Type` to prevent browser CSRF.

## Process lifecycle

Every command the bridge spawns (`/exec`, `run_command`, PTY shells, Git subprocesses) starts in its own process group. Signals target that group; interactive shells can put background jobs into separate groups, which may survive shell cleanup:

- **Kill semantics:** sending `Kill` with no signal (or `KILL`/`SIGKILL`) terminates the whole process group immediately. `TERM`/`SIGTERM` and `HUP`/`SIGHUP` signal the group directly. `INT`/`SIGINT` on a PTY session instead writes `^C` to the terminal, matching a real Ctrl+C — it interrupts whatever's in the foreground rather than killing the shell itself.
- **Timeouts:** a `run_command`/`/exec` timeout, or the client disconnecting mid-request, terminates the command's process group (SIGTERM, then SIGKILL after a 2 s grace period) instead of leaving it (and any children) running.
- **Output capping:** `/exec` keeps the first 256 KiB and last 768 KiB of each of stdout/stderr per stream, with an omission marker in between, so a runaway command can't exhaust memory.
- **Session reaping:** exited terminal/process sessions are removed 30 minutes after they exit, freeing their output buffers; running sessions are never reaped, however long they've been open.
- **Graceful shutdown:** on Ctrl+C or `SIGTERM`, the bridge stops accepting new connections and terminates every session's process group (with the same grace period) before exiting.
