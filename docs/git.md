# Git pane

Open **Files → Changes** for working-tree changes and the top-level **History**
side menu for commits. History is a resizable panel and remains mounted when
collapsed; its visibility, position and width are saved with your account.
The same controls work for every opened project.

## Working changes

Use a file's context menu to stage, unstage or revert it. Reverting asks for
confirmation before discarding tracked changes. Enter a commit message and choose
**Commit staged changes** to commit exactly the index. The Staged and Unstaged
sections can be collapsed; use each file’s plus/minus icon or Stage all / Unstage
all to move changes between them. A file with both indexed and working edits
appears in both sections. Save editor changes before staging. A nested project
will refuse a commit if the index also contains changes outside that project;
open the repository root or unstage those files first.

When a model is configured, an empty commit message is filled automatically after
staging settles, using only the indexed diff. Your edits are preserved. The
sparkles icon requests another summary. No commit is made automatically.

Stashes have Save, Apply and Drop actions in their menus. Save includes untracked
files; Apply restores the index and keeps the stash. Drop asks for confirmation.
Open the repository root to manage stashes; nested project folders can list them.
The existing draft-description actions and `/commit` command remain available.

The branch picker switches branches or creates a new branch. Checkout preserves
uncommitted work; Git reports a conflict if switching would overwrite it.
The hamburger menu contains **Fetch**, **Pull** and **Push**, which show progress and their output or error. Pull uses
rebase; push establishes tracking when needed. Operations use the branch's
configured upstream, falling back to `origin` and the current branch.
See [Git SSH setup](git-ssh.md) for execution-host authentication.

## History

- Search commit messages automatically after a 300 ms pause in typing, or filter by a local branch, remote branch or tag.
- Inspect colored branch/merge tracks, reference labels, subjects, authors,
  dates and short hashes. Load older commits at the bottom.
- Select a commit for its full message, hash, author and committer details,
  references and a changed-file tree. Merge commits let you compare each parent.
- Select a changed file for its read-only, syntax-highlighted diff with original
  line numbers. The file tree stays visible. **Open current file in editor** opens
  its current version. Repository History stays inline; resize the panel for more space.
- Use **View file history** in a file’s action menu to open a file-specific modal
  with a branch dropdown, dated revision timeline and the same read-only inspector.
  Renames are followed within the opened project; choose a timeline point or commit
  to inspect that revision.
- The history hamburger menu contains branch actions. **Checkout branch** switches the selected branch. A remote branch creates a
  local tracking branch; **New branch** opens the usual branch-name prompt.

Tracks follow the parents recorded by Git. Squash merges appear as a single
commit; rebased commits follow their rewritten ancestry. Retained pre-rebase
refs appear as separate tracks. Octopus and nested merges preserve every parent.

History loads 100 commits at a time, up to 2,000 for a query. Narrow the search or
reference filter to explore another part of a large repository. File history searches the newest 2,000 revisions of that file. Diff previews
stop at 5,000 lines or 512 KiB and say when they are limited; choosing a file
usually gives a smaller preview. Binary changes are identified by Git's diff
output. Project, account and execution-host changes invalidate pending results.
