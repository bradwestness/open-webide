# Your first session

## Sign in

Open the app at the address used during installation, such as
`http://localhost:8080/` for Docker. Register the first account; registration
closes afterward. Sessions and preferences belong to that account and are stored
in the app's database.

## Connect a model

Open **Servers** and use the setup wizard to choose a provider, enter its URL and
authentication, and discover models. Open WebIDE supports Ollama and
OpenAI-compatible servers such as llama.cpp and LM Studio. The server must be
reachable from the runtime handling the request; `localhost` inside a container
refers to that container.

Review detected model settings before applying them, including context capacity
and output limits. Choose a primary model in **Settings**. You can also choose a
fast model for automatic approval decisions. Server/model configuration is shared;
your default model selections are personal preferences.

You can rerun setup from Servers to discover models again or revise configuration.
Use `/model` in Chat to change the model for your conversation. Type `/` for
command suggestions; see [chat commands and goals](chat-controls.md) for
activity summaries, manual compaction and saved objectives.

The saved auto-compaction threshold defaults to 85% of the context window;
0 disables it. Compaction summarizes older history before model requests while
keeping the original messages in the database. See
[context compaction](architecture.md#shared-feature-boundaries) for implementation details.

## Open a project and ask a question

Choose **Open remote** for folders on the app host or **Open local** for folders
on this device. See [workspace capabilities](workspaces.md) before using a local
folder for commands or Git.

Start with a question such as “Explain how this project is organized.” Confirm
that the agent can read the expected files before asking it to change them.
Keep unrelated work in separate sessions so each conversation has focused context.

## Review changes

Approval modes determine when the agent asks before acting. Start with **Manual**;
`Shift+Tab` cycles the available modes. New sessions start in **Auto**, so switch
to Manual if you want explicit approval for tools that require it.

| Mode | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Manual | Ask before tools that require approval. |
| Auto-accept edits | Approve file writes automatically; ask before other tools that require approval. |
| Auto | Use the fast or primary model to approve routine actions; ask about risky or uncertain actions. |
| YOLO | Approve all tools automatically, including shell commands. |

Review pending edits with **Accept** or **Reject** and inspect file diffs before
committing. Command and Git tools run with the execution bridge's host permissions.
Chat history and tool results help you see what happened; keep file backups until
you no longer need to reject or restore changes.
