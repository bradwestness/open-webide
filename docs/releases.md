# Releases and upgrades

Open WebIDE is currently pre-release (`0.1.0`). Registry installation files and the
release workflow are prepared; published alpha/beta/RC builds can be distributed
before stable `v1.0.0`. Download instructions become available when the first
release or prerelease is published and its GHCR package is made public.

## Install a published release

After the first release is published, download `docker-compose.yml` from
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/openwebide/openwebide/releases). It uses a
versioned GHCR image and requires no checkout or Rust build. From a dedicated
installation directory:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/source
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

Open <http://localhost:8080/> and register the first account. Set
`OPENWEBIDE_WORKSPACE=/path/to/projects` before starting if your projects are
elsewhere. Configure your model server through **Servers**. From a container,
`localhost` refers to the container; use an address reachable from that container
for a model running on another machine or the host. Models and host language
toolchains are supplied separately.

Use [Tailscale HTTPS](tailscale.md) for access from other devices and local browser
folder permissions. Release assets also include a standalone HTTPS Compose file
and `serve-config.sh`, plus [Podman Quadlet units](podman-quadlet.md).

The Quadlet assets track the release channel (`latest`, `alpha`, `beta` or `rc`)
and enable registry auto-updates; the Compose assets default to the specific version.
See the automatic-update options below.

The image includes both WASM components and the server-side bridge for remote
projects. The optional standalone bridge archives support Linux/macOS on amd64
and arm64; they do not contain the Spin backend or browser app. Verify downloaded
files against `SHA256SUMS` (`sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS` on Linux, or
`shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS` on macOS, for a directory containing all assets).
Extract the matching archive and run `./openwebide-bridge --help`; its bundled
reference describes host requirements and configuration.

## Configuration

| Setting | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OPENWEBIDE_IMAGE` | `ghcr.io/openwebide/openwebide:latest` in repository install files; pinned in Compose release assets | Override the Compose container image/version. |
| `OPENWEBIDE_WORKSPACE` | `$HOME/source` in Compose | Host projects directory mounted at `/workspace`. |
| `OPENWEBIDE_DATA_VOLUME` | `openwebide-data` | Named app data volume; set to an existing volume name when migrating an older install. |
| `OPENWEBIDE_TAILSCALE_VOLUME` | `openwebide-tailscale-data` | Named Tailscale state volume in HTTPS Compose; preserve an existing identity by selecting its old volume. |
| `OPENWEBIDE_BRIDGE` | `1` | Enable the bundled execution bridge; `0` uses SSE chat without its command/terminal features. |
| `OPENWEBIDE_BRIDGE_ALLOWED_HOSTS` | Empty | Comma-separated hostnames allowed by the bridge; localhost and IP literals already work. |
| `OPENWEBIDE_BRIDGE_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Empty | Additional comma-separated browser origins when the app and bridge use different hostnames. |
| `SPIN_VARIABLE_BRIDGE_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:3001` | Backend bridge URL for a source/native installation. |
| `SPIN_VARIABLE_BRIDGE_SECRET` | Empty | Required shared secret for a backend reaching a non-loopback bridge. |

The bundled entrypoint configures the bridge URL/secret itself. For external bridge
configuration, use the [bridge reference](execution-bridge.md). HTTPS deployment
has its own `OPENWEBIDE_TAILSCALE_*`, `OPENWEBIDE_SERVE_CONFIG_DIR` and `TS_AUTHKEY`
settings described in the [Tailscale guide](tailscale.md). Model URLs, credentials
and runtime profiles are configured in **Servers**; user defaults and preferences
are in **Settings**, persisted in SQLite.

## Upgrade and restore

### Existing installations with the old project name

Deployment names now use `openwebide`. Before replacing an older Compose file,
inspect its mounted volume names with `docker compose config` and
`docker inspect <existing-app-container>`. Stop the old deployment using its old
Compose file, and set `OPENWEBIDE_DATA_VOLUME` in the new installation's `.env` to
the existing app data volume name (often `open-webide_openwebide-data`). For HTTPS,
set `OPENWEBIDE_TAILSCALE_VOLUME` to its existing Tailscale state volume too. Retain
the enrolled node name via `OPENWEBIDE_TAILSCALE_NAME` and its full hostname via
`OPENWEBIDE_TAILSCALE_HOST`. This reuses the account database, bridge secret and
Tailscale identity instead of creating fresh volumes.

For older Quadlet installs, stop the old service and copy its data directory into
`~/.local/state/openwebide/data/` before installing the renamed units, or keep the
old data path in the new unit's `Volume=` line. Remove the old unit files and reload
systemd so only the renamed service starts. Keep the old data/volume until the new
installation has been verified; do not delete volumes as part of renaming.

### Routine upgrades

Compose uses the explicit `openwebide` project name and stable data volume name.
Preserve any configured volume overrides on every upgrade. Read the target release's
changelog first. Stop the app and back up its entire data directory before pulling:

```sh
docker compose stop
mkdir -p backups
docker compose run -T --rm --no-deps --entrypoint tar openwebide \
  -czf - -C /app .spin > "backups/openwebide-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).tar.gz"
```

Choose a unique backup filename for each upgrade. This archive contains accounts,
sessions, settings and the bridge secret. Back up your project files independently,
including `.openwebide/backups/` while pending agent changes need restoration.
For native installs, stop Spin and the bridge and copy the entire `.spin/` directory.
For Quadlet, stop the service and copy `~/.local/state/openwebide/data/`.

Set `OPENWEBIDE_IMAGE=ghcr.io/openwebide/openwebide:v<version>` in the installation's
`.env` file, then run `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`. Quadlet users
change `Image=` in `openwebide.image`, reload systemd, and restart
`openwebide-image.service` followed by `openwebide.service`.

SQLite migrations run automatically once per schema version. An older build
refuses to open a newer database; downgrading the image alone is not a rollback.
To roll back, stop the app, restore the full pre-upgrade data directory and the
previous image version, then restart. Restore project files separately if a run
changed them. Do not use `docker compose down -v` during upgrades: it deletes data.

After upgrading, sign in and verify an existing session, settings, a streaming
response and file access in both workspace modes. Close all app windows and reopen
to activate the new PWA shell; local folders may need **Grant folder access** again.

## Automatic updates

Podman units include `Pull=newer`, `AutoUpdate=registry` and a rolling channel
image (`latest` for stable releases). Enable `podman-auto-update.timer` as shown
in the [Quadlet guide](podman-quadlet.md#upgrade).

Docker Compose has no built-in background update service. Its equivalent is a
scheduled job that runs `docker compose pull` followed by `docker compose up -d`
in the existing installation directory. The [pull command](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/compose/pull/)
downloads images; [up](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/compose/up/)
recreates services whose images changed. `restart: unless-stopped` alone does not
check for new images.

Set `OPENWEBIDE_IMAGE=ghcr.io/openwebide/openwebide:latest` in your installation's
`.env` file to follow releases. On Linux, this example user service and timer
check daily; replace the working directory and Docker binary path as needed.
The user running the service must have access to the Docker daemon.

```ini
# ~/.config/systemd/user/openwebide-update.service
[Unit]
Description=Update Open WebIDE containers

[Service]
Type=oneshot
WorkingDirectory=%h/openwebide
ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker compose pull
ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker compose up -d
TimeoutStartSec=900
```

```ini
# ~/.config/systemd/user/openwebide-update.timer
[Unit]
Description=Check for Open WebIDE updates daily

[Timer]
OnCalendar=daily
Persistent=true
RandomizedDelaySec=30m

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
```

```sh
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now openwebide-update.timer
```

For HTTPS Compose, include `-f docker-compose.https.yml` in both `ExecStart`
commands. On other hosts, schedule those same commands with the platform's task
scheduler. Keep regular backups: automatic updates restart the app and apply
database migrations. Use a versioned tag and disable the update timer when you
want to control upgrade timing.

## Alpha, beta and release-candidate channels

Each published build has a versioned image tag and a rolling channel tag:

| Git tag / versioned image tag | Rolling image tag | GitHub Release |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `v1.0.0-alpha.1` | `alpha` | Prerelease |
| `v1.0.0-beta.1` | `beta` | Prerelease |
| `v1.0.0-rc.1` | `rc` | Prerelease |
| `v1.0.0` | `latest` | Stable |

Prereleases update only their own channel and are never marked as GitHub's latest
release. Stable publication updates `latest`. Channels follow the most recently
published build; publish version tags sequentially so an older build finishing
later does not replace a newer channel image.

For Compose, set `OPENWEBIDE_IMAGE=ghcr.io/openwebide/openwebide:alpha` in `.env`
to follow alphas, or use `:v1.0.0-alpha.1` to pin one build. For Podman, set the
same image in `openwebide.image`; the auto-update timer follows the chosen channel.
Downloaded prerelease Quadlet assets already select their own channel rather than
`latest`. A channel exists only after its first build is published.

Publishing an alpha does not declare the 1.0 milestone complete. The same version,
changelog, CI and packaging gates apply, but known limitations can be documented
in prerelease notes while stable-release verification continues.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Check |
| --- | --- |
| Image cannot be pulled | The release exists and the GHCR package is public; unpublished versions cannot be installed. |
| App is unavailable | `docker compose ps`, `docker compose logs --tail=100`, port 8080 and volume permissions. |
| Health API returns 401 | `/api/health` requires sign-in; this is expected for an unsigned request. |
| Model connection fails | Container-reachable model URL, authentication and model-server logs. |
| Bridge disconnected | `/health` on bridge port 3001, hostname/origin allowlists, or `/bridge/health` through HTTPS. |
| Local command/Git tools missing | The optional bridge must be on the browser's device and see the selected folder; browser-only local editing does not require it. |
| Remote edits do not reach host files | Workspace mount and Spin's `--direct-mounts --allow-transient-write` flags; source installs need normal host access. |
| Local folder cannot reopen | Chromium browser, secure HTTPS/localhost origin, and **Grant folder access**. |

Use the [support issue form](https://github.com/openwebide/openwebide/issues/new/choose)
with your version, deployment method, browser and workspace mode.

## Maintainer release procedure

1. For stable 1.0, finish the release gates in the [roadmap](roadmap.md), including both-mode
   verification and hands-on device/environment checks. The prepared pipeline alone
   does not complete the 1.0 milestone.
2. Run the **Release** workflow manually on the intended commit. This runs CI,
   builds/smoke-tests images on native Linux amd64/arm64 runners and packages native
   Linux/macOS bridges; it uploads artifacts without publishing GHCR or a release.
   Validate downloaded archives and try the install assets with a locally loaded
   matching image via `OPENWEBIDE_IMAGE`. Exercise Compose and rootless Quadlet,
   persistence, upgrades, both workspace modes and real-model streaming.
3. Set the same version in `Cargo.toml` and `spin.toml`, update `Cargo.lock`, and
   move shipped changelog entries into its versioned section, leaving Unreleased
   for subsequent work. Supported versions are `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` and
   `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-alpha.N`, `-beta.N` or `-rc.N` (numeric `N`, no leading zeros).
   For an initial alpha, use `1.0.0-alpha.1` and `## [1.0.0-alpha.1] - YYYY-MM-DD`;
   for stable 1.0, use `1.0.0`. Update the README/site/guide to describe the actual
   release status. Run `python3 tools/release.py validate --tag v<version>`.
4. Commit the reviewed release changes and push the corresponding `v<version>` tag.
   Tag builds require matching manifest/lock versions and nonempty tagged changelog
   notes, then run all CI checks before packaging or publication. The workflow
   pushes native platform images, merges their digests into the versioned tag, attaches
   archives/install files/checksums to a draft GitHub Release, publishes it and
   updates the appropriate channel. Alpha/beta/RC releases carry GitHub's prerelease
   flag and leave the stable `latest` image and release untouched.
5. On the first publication, set the GHCR package to **Public** in package settings
   and check it is linked to this repository (the image carries the source label).
   Verify an anonymous pull for both architectures and the versioned release install.
   A first package may be private until this setting is changed; announce it only
   after anonymous installation works. See [GitHub package visibility](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/learn-github-packages/configuring-a-packages-access-control-and-visibility).

The release workflow needs only the repository's `GITHUB_TOKEN` with
`contents: write` and `packages: write` in publishing jobs. No external registry,
signing account or persistent publishing secret is required. macOS archives are
unsigned; verify their checksums and assess signing/notarization if distribution
requirements change. See [native multi-platform image builds](https://docs.docker.com/build/ci/github-actions/multi-platform/)
and [draft-first GitHub Releases](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository).
